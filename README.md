# flyt
Super-light javascript library to flatten arrays

### Outline

This library exposes functionality to transalte an array of
arbitarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. 
`[[1, 2, [3]], 4] -> [1, 2, 3, 4]`
It is trivial code but organised to support future extensions and is just
one step away from `npm publish`.

### Features

1. Bundles library code into all library targets ie CommonJS, AMD, ES2015 exports, UMD.

### Drawback

Built for demonstration purposes.
